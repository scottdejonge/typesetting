      <h1>Typesetting</h1>
      <p>This example should prove that through using simple <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, and semantic <abbr title="Hypertext Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, along with effective typesetting design content can be visually appealing whilst also being natively accessible, responsive, and performant.</p>
      <h2>Chapter 1: <em>Setting the problem space</em></h2>
      <p>In order to properly define the problem space we will set design limitations to ensure there are objective outcomes to the design process. These design limitations are as follows:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><em>The smaller is better:</em> the download payload for all styles, assets, and markup should be minised as much as possible.</li>
        <li><em>Keep it simple:</em> all styles should be defined using simple, modern, and understandable <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> properties, this means no opinionated development workflows such as Sass, Less etc.</li>
        <li><em>Effecient design is good design:</em> whilst we should minimise technical understanding, this should not interfere with reusable well defined code, therefore we will utlilise PostCSS, Autoprefixer and CSSNext to automate cross-browser compatiblity.</li>
        <li><em>Legibility is the primary goal:</em> we will use a well structured typeface (<a href="https://edwardtufte.github.io/et-book/"><abbr title="Edward Tufte">ET</abbr> Book</a>) along with formatted <abbr title="Hypertext Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr> tags to emphasis content.</li>
