      <h1>Typesetting Design on the Web</h1>
      <p>This example should prove that through using simple <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, and semantic <abbr title="Hypertext Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, along with effective typesetting design content can be visually appealing whilst also being natively accessible, responsive, and performant.</p>
      <h2>Chapter 1: <em>Setting the problem space</em></h2>
      <p>In order to properly define the problem space we will set design limitations to ensure there are objective outcomes to the design process. These design limitations are as follows:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><em>The smaller is better:</em> the download payload for all styles, assets, and markup should be minised as much as possible.</li>
        <li><em>Keep it simple:</em> all styles should be defined using simple, modern, and understandable <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> properties, this means no opinionated development workflows such as Sass, Less etc.</li>
        <li><em>Effecient design is good design:</em> whilst we should minimise technical understanding, this should not interfere with reusable well defined code, therefore we will utlilise PostCSS, Autoprefixer and CSSNext to automate cross-browser compatiblity.</li>
        <li><em>Legibility is the primary goal:</em> we will use a well structured typeface (<a href="https://edwardtufte.github.io/et-book/"><abbr title="Edward Tufte">ET</abbr> Book</a>) along with formatted <abbr title="Hypertext Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr> tags to emphasis content.</li>
        <li><em>Easy reading:</em> we will use a high contrast color palette (<abbr title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 AAA">WCAG 2.0 AAA</abbr>) and scaling vertical rythym to provide a clear visual heriarchy context.</li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Chapter 2: <em>Goals and objectives</em></h2>
      <p>To better measure the success of typesetting design on the web we will set the objectives of this example as the following:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><em>Clarity:</em> we will measure the clarity of the typographic design through automatic accessibility testing, ensuring color contrast and <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> tree heriarchy pass <abbr title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 AAA">WCAG 2.0 AAA</abbr> guidelines</li>
        <li><em>Consistancy:</em> we will ensure the consistant rendering of the design across browsers, mediums (screens and print), and devices.</li>
      </ol>
